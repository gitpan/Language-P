	- Parsing:
	    - Pre/post increment/decrement (++ and --) operators.
	    - Bitwise negation.
	    - Parsing of heredocs in substitutions.
	- Intermediate representation:
	    - Add an intermediate representation and use it as a base
	      for the Toy and Parrot code generators.
	    - Use the same instruction set for both stack-based IR and
	      SSA/register-based IR.
	    - Use basic blocks for the IR and add some opcode metadata
	      in inc/Opcodes.pm.
	- Toy runtime:
	    - Rewrite code generation to use the new IR representation.
	- Parrot runtime:
	    - Add a basic Parrot code generator/runtime.

	- Parsing:
	    - Anonymous subroutines and closed-over lexical variables.
	    - Improved parsing of dereferences using '->'.
	    - Labels, goto and loop control statements.
	    - local().
	    - continue blocks.
	    - Add file and line information to tokens and use it to
	      report parse errors.
	- Toy runtime:
	    - local() for plain scalars.
	    - Anonymous subroutines and closures.
	    - Implement all loops (for, foreach, while, until, bare blocks).
	    - Loop control statements (only when not requiring stack unwinding).
	- Move to Git on GitHub.
